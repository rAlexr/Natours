#### Natours is fictive "Nature Travel Agency"

The project is from udemy, and following this course I learned a lot about structuring my SCSS/SASS files, animation, layout and more. I will detail more below about what I learned.

Natours is the first part of a big lecture which aims to build 3 projects with 3 different technology.

So I will resume here what I learned form this one :

**Structure**

- 7 to 1 method for SCSS

- BEM method for classes

- reuse snippets of code / strengthen the understanding of **DRY** principle

**Style**

- SCSS / how a css preprocessor works / strong understanding of variables/mixins/partials/functions and structure in general

- how to animate in different states / lots of css triks

- best practice for layouts

- responsove design / images / how top aply media on SCSS partials properly

- how to create a card with 2 perspective
