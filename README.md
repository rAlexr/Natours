#### Natours is fictive "Nature Travel Agency"

The project is from udemy, and following this course I learned a lot about structuring my SCSS files, animation, layout and more. I will detail more below about what I learned.

Natours is the first part of a big lecture which aims to build 3 projects with 3 different technology.It cover Float, Flex and Grid. Natours is using float for layout.

So I will resume here what I learned form this one :
